Rain On Me - Lady Gaga & Ariana Grande

Mary:
I didn't ask for a free ride


I only ask you to show me a real good time

I never asked for the rainfall

At least I showed up

You showed me nothing at all

-Feito por Mary

Murilo:
It's coming down on me
Water like misery
It's coming down on me

I'd rather be dry but at least I'm alive
Rain on me, rain rain
Rain on me, rain rain
- Feito por Viadinho
